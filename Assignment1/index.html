        The first thing I paid attention to was the movement of the initial 3D
        menu when hovering my cursor over each icon.

        Q3 What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging
        with?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I spent the most time engaging with the the interactive 3D islands and
        menus to see what would happen with each interaction
      </p>
      <h3>
        Q4 What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with
        the experience?
      </h3>
      <p>
        My most common action was scrolling to explore either the menus or
        individual pages
      </p>
      <h3>
        Q5 What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the
        interactive experience?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I felt as though the intended goal of the experience was to engage
        audiences by demonstrating the company's creative talents. It was
        designed to be both informational about the company while also being an
        entertaining interactive experience.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Q6 How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
      </h3>
      <p>
        It primarily achieves this effect with the moving, ineractive 3d
        elements. The dynamic pages that change as you scroll also help to
        achieve this, keeping the user engaged with changing elements that
        convey the company's messages while maintaining engagement.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Q7 What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted
        with over time? (For how long and how many different times)
      </h3>
      <p>
        I get the impression that the experience should be interacted with for
        around 20 minutes as the user explores the full webste. It may be
        experienced multiple times if the user needs something different out of
        each visit.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Q8 How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
        interacted with over time?
      </h3>
      <p>
        It communicated that it should be interacted with for a significant
        amount of time, as each individual page tended to lead into another once
        the user reached the end, guiding them to stay in the experience for
        longer and explore everything.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Q9 What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
        reference?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The experience references other media forms such as 3D design,
        photography, digital art.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Q10 What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
        act when engaging with your research experience?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The moving, responsive 3D media references communicate that you should
        take the time to interact with it to experience it to the fullest.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Q11 What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
        feel when engaging with your research experience?
      </h3>
      <p>
        It evokes a feeling of curiousity, leading you to wonder how the various
        elements will respond to interaction.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Q12 What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what
        makes that part frustrating?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The most frustrating part of the interaction was some of the navigation.
        Because of all the various styles of interaction and layout throughout
        the pages, backtracking and finding specific information could at times
        be difficult.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Q13 What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what
        makes that part satisfying?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The most satisfying part of the interaction was how certain images and
        elements would move in response to the cursor. This is because it made
        the interaction feel responsive and dynamic.
